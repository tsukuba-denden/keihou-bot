# Feature Specification: Ëß£Èô§ÈÄöÁü•„ÅÆÂÆüË£Ö

**Feature Branch**: `003-`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ëß£Èô§ÈÄöÁü•„ÅÆÂÆüË£Ö"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a weather warning is cancelled, the user is notified of the cancellation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is subscribed to notifications for a specific region, and a warning is active for that region, **When** the warning is cancelled, **Then** the user receives a notification indicating that the warning has been lifted.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the cancellation notice is received, but there was no prior warning notification sent?
- How does the system handle multiple cancellations for different warnings in a short period?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST be able to detect when a weather warning has been cancelled from the JMA data.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST send a notification to users who were previously notified about an active warning when that warning is cancelled.
- **FR-003**: The cancellation notification MUST clearly state which warning has been lifted.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST update its internal state to reflect that the warning is no longer active.
- **FR-005**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a way for users to opt-out of cancellation notifications specifically, or is it tied to the main warning notification subscription?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cancellation Notification**: Represents the message sent to the user when a warning is lifted. It should contain information about the original warning.
