# Feature Specification: Display Alerts in Embeds

**Feature Branch**: `002-embed`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Embed„Å´„Åó„Å¶"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, when a new JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) alert is issued, I want to see it posted in the Discord channel as a well-formatted embed so that I can quickly understand the alert's content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the bot detects a new weather warning, **When** it posts the warning to a Discord channel, **Then** the message MUST be a single, formatted embed.
2. **Given** an alert embed is posted, **When** a user views it, **Then** the embed MUST clearly display the alert title, the affected area, and the full description.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the alert text is longer than the Discord embed field/description limit? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should long alerts be handled? Truncation, multiple fields, or multiple embeds?]
- How does the system handle alerts that are issued but contain no actual warning text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST send new JMA alerts to the configured Discord channel as embed messages instead of plain text.
- **FR-002**: The embed MUST include the title of the JMA alert.
- **FR-003**: The embed MUST include the target area for the alert.
- **FR-004**: The embed MUST include the description text of the alert.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST gracefully handle alert text that exceeds Discord's embed character limits. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The specific handling method must be defined, e.g., truncate the text with a 'read more' link, or split the text across multiple fields or embeds.]
